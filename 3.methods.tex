First, essential cancer reports have been checked, from which many difficulties were collected, both from left open conclusions and discussions.

Then, focusing on this work's proposal, gene order chronology papers were retrieved and scanned for supportive examples. Amongst the examined references, pathway dysrgulation appeared as a promising line of study, which ended up as a whole section due its relation to our theme and relative importance in the new advances in terms of research.

Along the full search, complications related to chronology and heterogeneity seemed to have multiple sources. Amongst the major ones, inheritance challenged the full order-based scheme by including extra difficulties, hence establishing itself as a substantial argument to discuss.
