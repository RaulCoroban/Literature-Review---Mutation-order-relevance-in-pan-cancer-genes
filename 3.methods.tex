First, I checked essential cancer-related works that focused on treatment unresponsiveness and divergent patient evolution.

Then, gene order chronology papers were retrieved and scanned for supportive examples. Pathway dysregulation appeared as the next stage of discussion since its occurrence is a direct consequence of gene dysregulation.

Last, I included the inheritance variable analysis and its implications in the order-based approach. Its importance lays in the challenges it sets in and time order.
