Chronological order can be important:
Because sets an accumulation of consequences that lead the evolution of the disease.
\\

Unlock cancerous properties at different stages, which can speed up some stage transitions or slow them down, all depending on cellâ€™s biological age.
\\
There is a point where chronological order looses relevance, despite managing evolution: If the accumulated mutation set is enough to already converge to a final (metastatic?) stage in a short biological life-span, there is no use of knowing the order.

Which states some mutations are interchangeable in terms of chronological order since they have the same effect and do not impact heavily in microenvironment and therefore progression.
