Cancers remain one of the greatest challenges of our time. Its cause and evolution understanding seem to be related to the chronological order in which its driver mutations occur. We have gathered studies in which prognosis and patient stratification could be elucidated via order analysis, either at gene or pathway level. Besides, once established a feasible scenario, we have added the insight of hereditary mutations, which seem to defy order-driven approaches.
