Cancers remain one of the greatest challenges of our time. In this work, we discuss whether its evolution might be related to the chronological order in which its cells' driver mutations occur. I have gathered studies in which prognosis and patient stratification could be elucidated via order analysis, either at a gene or pathway level. Besides, I have discussed the insight of hereditary mutations, which alter the order-driven approach.
